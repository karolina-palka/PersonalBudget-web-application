#PersonalBudget 
This app helps you deal with your personal budget. No longer need to use sticky notes because all the knowledge about your finances are at one place. As a logged in user you can use the following functions: add new income, add new expense, show balance from the current month, previous month or the chosen period of time. You can also browse your records sorted by date. 
For now only frontend is done.
